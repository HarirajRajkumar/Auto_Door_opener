# Auto_Door_opener
Enables user to close and open door using a servo ( It's just a prototype )

This following Arduino sketch is written to control door open and close movement using a 
   Servo motor (for movement) by reading object in front of the door (using IR sensor)
   
   Here, a servo library is used to control a SERVO motor for movements
   
   Link to download the library file
   https://github.com/arduino-libraries/Servo
   (Use the above link incase if the library is not already attached with the IDE)
   
   To check whether the SERVO library is attached or not
   1. Go to >>Sketch.
   2. Go to >>Include Library.
   3. See under >>Arduino libraries.

Open the ino file using your IDE and enjoy :D . Please feel to follow me.. Thank You developer !
